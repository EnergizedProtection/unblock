## Sources

We have been collecting these whitelisted domains from the user reports, online communities (Ex. Reddit, Telegram, XDA) and our personal usage since  the very early days of our beginning. Thanks to all the users and supporters out there for helping us improve day by day. [You guys are awesome](http://iamawesome.com/)!


## Support

Maintaining a quality blocking project takes a lot of time. Energized Protection is completely independently funded. We fight for our users. This does mean
however that we also have to spend our owns to pay the bills. This is where you can help: by chipping in you can ensure more time is spent improving Energized rather than dealing with distractions.

This donation is for our services, not for any pack, resource or any other mean. Your support will help us keep the project running and provide you quality service.

## Disclaimer

Energized Protection unBlock Lists are basically `whitelists` files to unblock access of legit domains. If you don't know how it works, nothing to worry about! Because this wouldn't break you internet usage experience alongside your device! :P
